# Projetos
This is my repository for full projects I developed for improving my skills.

First project: Data Minering and Data Visualization with PowerBI.

In this project I created a small market database in MySQL, populating the database and creating a view to extract data, supplying it to a PowerBI dashboard created to respond the following questions:

A) Mensal mean sales.
B) Sales by product.
C) The best suppliers, considering the number of saled products.
D) Mean sales by sales man.
E) Sales by State.
D) Expected sales for next year.


Second Project: Bradesco Income.

This is a real challenge proposed by Bradesco bank, where I had to clean the datasupplied in an excel file and determine the supposed income in the next five years.
The excel data was import to jupyter notebook where I applied python to clean the null values, I transposed the matrix, and created a CSV file. The CSV file was imported into PowwerBi where I coorected the data types, and the datetime column to help create some graphs to understand the data. After that I created the future income projection of five years, using the total data series column with a confidence of 95%. I also created a KPI comparing the max total value and the average total value.
